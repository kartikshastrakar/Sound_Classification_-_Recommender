## Required libraries
* pandas is the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language
* Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. 
* Seaborn is an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Seaborn works easily with dataframes and the Pandas library. The graphs created can also be customized easily.
* TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
* Read [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) docs to perform ML operations
